<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p> My name is Yanwu Xu, and I currently work at Google Cloud, where I focus on on-device generative models, including text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Prior to joining Google, I was a Research Scientist at Snap Inc.,
  developing efficient generative models optimized for on-device applications. I earned my Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Boston University, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.batman-lab.com/">Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich</a>
  and co-advised by <a href="https://mingming-gong.github.io/">Dr. Mingming Gong</a>. Prior to my current endeavors, I earned an M.S. degree from the Intelligent System Program at the University of Pittsburgh in 2022.
