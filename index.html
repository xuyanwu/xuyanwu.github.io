<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p> I am Yanwu Xu, a PhD student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department at Boston University, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.batman-lab.com/">Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich</a> and co-advised by <a href="https://mingming-gong.github.io/">Dr. Mingming Gong</a>. Prior to my current endeavors, I earned an M.S. degree from the Intelligent System Program at the University of Pittsburgh in 2022.
<br />
My primary research revolves around Generative Models. This encompasses a foundational exploration of Denoising Diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Learning. On the application front, I am engrossed in developing large-scale multimodal generative models for text-to-image generation, relevant in both the computer vision and medical imaging spheres.

Despite the proliferation of generative models, achieving fast sampling during
inference without compromising sample diversity and quality remains challenging.
Existing models such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) deliver
high-quality, diverse samples but are slowed by an inherently high number of iterative steps. The Denoising Diffusion Generative Adversarial Networks (DDGAN)
attempted to circumvent this limitation by integrating a GAN model for larger
jumps in the diffusion process. However, DDGAN encountered scalability limitations when applied to large datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel approach that tackles the problem by matching implicit and explicit factors.
More specifically, our approach involves utilizing an implicit model to match the
marginal distributions of noisy data and the explicit conditional distribution of
the forward diffusion. This combination allows us to effectively match the joint
denoising distributions. Unlike DDPM but similar to DDGAN, we do not enforce
a parametric distribution for the reverse step, enabling us to take large steps during
inference. Similar to the DDPM but unlike DDGAN, we take advantage of the
exact form of the diffusion process. We demonstrate that our proposed method
obtains comparable generative performance to diffusion-based models and vastly
superior results to models with a small number of sampling steps.
