  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Congrats to our Conditional GAN paper accepted by NeuralIPS 2019 (Spotlight 2.4%)! In this work, Dr. Mingming Gong and me have the equal contribution to this work which solve a critical problem in AC-GAN. Below is the general idea of our work.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"><span class="Apple-converted-space">            </span></span><span class="s1">Conditional generative models enjoy remarkable progress over the past few years. One of the popular conditional models is Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), which generates highly discriminative images by extending the loss function of GAN with an auxiliary classifier. However, the diversity of the generated samples by AC-GAN tends to decrease as the number of classes increases, hence limiting its power on large-scale data. In this paper, we identify the source of the low diversity issue theoretically and propose a practical solution to solve the problem. We show that the auxiliary classifier in AC-GAN imposes perfect separability, which is disadvantageous when the supports of the class distributions have significant overlap. To address the issue, we propose Twin Auxiliary Classifiers Generative Adversarial Net (TAC-GAN) that further benefits from a new player that interacts with other players (the generator and the discriminator) in GAN. Theoretically, we demonstrate that TAC-GAN can effectively minimize the divergence between the generated and real-data distributions. Extensive experimental results show that our TAC-GAN can successfully replicate the true data distributions on simulated data, and significantly improves the diversity of class-conditional image generation on real datasets. <br>
