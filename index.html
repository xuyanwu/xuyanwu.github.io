<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Yanwu Xu, currently a 1st-year PhD student in Intellegent System at 
  University of Pittsburgh, advised by <a href="https://kayhan.dbmi.pitt.edu">Dr. Kayhan Batmanghelich</a> 
  and co-advised by <a href="https://mingming-gong.github.io/">Dr. Mingming Gong</a>.
  My current research interests are <b>Generative Adversarial Learning </b> and <b>Domain Transfer</b>. 
  Before that, I obtained B.S. degree in Electrical Mechanical Engineering department at Central South University in 2017.</p>

  <li><p>Congrats to our Conditional GAN paper accepted by NeuralIPS 2019 (Spotlight 2.4%)!. In this work, Dr. Mingming Gong and me have the equal
    contribution to this work which solve a critical problem in AC-GAN. below is the general idea of our work. <br/>
    
    Conditional generative models enjoy remarkable progress over the past few years. One of the popular conditional models is
    Auxiliary Classifier GAN (AC-GAN), which generates highly discriminative images by extending the loss function of GAN with
    an auxiliary classifier. However, the diversity of the generated samples by AC-GAN tends to decrease as the number of 
    classes increases, hence limiting its power on large-scale data. In this paper, we identify the source of the low diversity 
    issue theoretically and propose a practical solution to solve the problem. We show that the auxiliary classifier in AC-GAN 
    imposes perfect separability, which is disadvantageous when the supports of the class distributions have significant 
    overlap. To address the issue, we propose Twin Auxiliary Classifiers Generative Adversarial Net (TAC-GAN) that further 
    benefits from a new player that interacts with other players (the generator and the discriminator) in GAN. Theoretically, 
    we demonstrate that TAC-GAN can effectively minimize the divergence between the generated and real-data distributions. 
    Extensive experimental results show that our TAC-GAN can successfully replicate the true data distributions on simulated 
    data, and significantly improves the diversity of class-conditional image generation on real datasets.
